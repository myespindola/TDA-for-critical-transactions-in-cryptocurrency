# TDA for critical transactions in cryptocurrency

We analyze the time series of four main
cryptocurrencies before the digital market crash in 2017-
2018. We will build on a methodology that combines topological
data analysis with a machine learning technique to automatically
recognize the regime in a complex system approaching a critical
transition. Then we will find early warning signals for critical
transitions in the cryptocurrency markets.
